//Bcrypt works by running a part of the algorithm many times to give you a secure hash, but that number of times is configurable. The higher the number, the more secure the hash but the longer it will take. 

//For development, use bcrypt-nodejs.  For faster results in production, use bcrypt.  In order to install bcrypt, you should first be able to compile (install gcc and make) on your system.  On ubuntu, simply install build-essentials package
//var bcrypt = require("bcrypt-nodejs");  Bcrypt is written in C++, while bcrypt-nodejs is 100% javascript, and do not require compilation.
//Do not forget to recompile bcrypt if gcc is updated on your system.

/*Note :  we use bcrypt.compare instead of a simple equality check (with something like ===). This is for security reasons : it helps keep us safe from a complicated hacker trick called a timing attack.  In cryptography, a timing attack is a side channel attack in which the attacker attempts to compromise a cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms.  Finding secrets through timing information may be significantly easier than using cryptanalysis of known plaintext, ciphertext pairs. Sometimes timing information is combined with cryptanalysis to improve the rate of information leakage.*/
